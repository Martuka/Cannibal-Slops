# Cannibal Slops  
### Early research sketch from the AI Cannibals project (2025)

**Cannibal Slops** investigates the phenomenon of *AI slop* and the self-cannibalism of generative models.  
Through recursive image-generation workflows and metabolic feedback loops, the project exposes the entropic drift of artificial intelligence systems and the aesthetic signatures of collapse.

This repository includes early research materials from the ongoing project **AI Cannibals**, which explores algorithmic self-degeneration as both a critical and poetic strategy.  
The included video and image illustrate the first iterations of the recursive degenerative process and the emergence of a visual language of collapse.

### Research context
These cannibalized slops are the initial outcome of **AI Cannibals**, an ongoing artistic research project aiming to develop algorithmic cannibal protocols as an open-source toolchain.  
The project seeks to make these protocols accessible and reproducible through an open-access platform, enabling artists, researchers, and developers to integrate computational sabotage practices into their own creative processes.
